# This is a rudimentary topology configuration for the MNIST handwritten digits.

input size 28x28

# From the input layer, we'll make three new layers: one with edges, and
# one lower-resolution sparse layer connected with a gaussian transfer function,
# and one fully connected layer with tanh transfer function:

layerEdges size 28x28 from input convolve {{-1,-1,-1},{-1,8,-1},{-1,-1,-1}}
layerG size 14x14 from input tf gaussian
layer1 size 28x28 from input 

# Here we combine the preceding layers:
layer2 size 14x14 from layer1
layer2 size 14x14 from layerEdges
layer2 size 14x14 from layerG

# and add a layer of depth for good measure:
layer3 size 12x12 from layer2

output size 10 from layer3
